AI Dream Interpretation

This is a mystical, multi-stage web application that provides users with personalized dream interpretations powered by an AI backend. The user journey is designed to be immersive, moving from an initial dream submission through an interactive question-and-answer phase, culminating in a detailed reading with key themes and visualizations.

The application features a unique visual identity for each stage, utilizing a static image background for the initial page and distinct full-screen video backgrounds for the details and results pages.
